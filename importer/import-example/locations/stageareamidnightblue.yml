  description: "You find yourself once again in the makeshift outdoor theater in the woods.\n
  There are paths leading north and south.\n
  \n
  A platform, now lively with a rehearsal, is just along one side.\n
  \n
  The actor, dressed in midnight blue, stands on the platform reciting poetry to another,
  who is sitting, trying to pull off his shoe. \n
  \n
  'I would not be the villain that thou thinkst for the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp.'\n
  \n
  In the back, a table with a notebook and pen sit unattended and on the ground nearby a
  basket is overflowing with discarded paper."
