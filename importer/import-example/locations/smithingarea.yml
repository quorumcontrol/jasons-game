  description: "Fever trees give way to a circle of marulas.\n
The soil dries and a hot, dusty breeze hits you in the face.\n
\n
You squint, emerging from the brush into an armory of sorts,
hardly shaded by an enormous baobab tree.  \n
What you assume are smithing tools hang on hooks from the wall of a rickety hovel.\n
\n
Next to the building—hardly a building—next to the shack a tall woman brings
a hammer up over her head and then down onto a sizzling piece of metal wedged
against an anvil.\n
Her skin is covered in blisters.\n
Her eyes are hardly open.\n
She is chained to the baobab tree."
