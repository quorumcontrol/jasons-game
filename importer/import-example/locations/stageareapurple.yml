  description: "You find yourself once again in the makeshift outdoor theater in the woods. \n
  There are paths leading north and south. \n
  \n
  A platform, now lively with a rehearsal is just along one side. \n
  \n
  The actor, dressed in purple, stands on the platform, reciting poetry to another,
  who is flapping on the ground like a fish. \n
  \n
  '...half the flood hath their heel cut. But fortune, mov'd, varies again.' \n
  \n
  In the back, a table with a notebook and pen sit unattended and on the ground
  nearby a basket is overflowing with discarded paper. "
