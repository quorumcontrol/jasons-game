  description: "You once again find yourself in the makeshift outdoor theater
in the woods.\n
There are paths leading north and south.\n
\n
A platform, lively with rehearsal is just along one side.\n
The actor, dressed in dark green, stands on the platform, reciting poetry to
another, who is standing on a ladder.\n
\n
'Nor that is not the lark whose notes do beat...'\n
\n
In the back, a table with a notebook and pen sit unattended and on the ground
nearby a basket is overflowing with discarded paper. "
