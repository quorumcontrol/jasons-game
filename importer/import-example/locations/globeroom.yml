  description: "You trudge through fresh, and somehow punishing, grassy fields
until you reach an oversized stone building.\n
\n
You, with great caution, enter the building.\n
You are in a huge hall. Dominating the room is an enormous sphere.\n
You imagine that if you stood on your toes you could barely touch the lower
tropic.  The continents are foreign.\n
\n
An enormous blue needle hangs from the ceiling and rests exactly where the
equator and the meridian meet.  Also in the room are three pedestals, each
with an etching on its face.  \n
A brass plaque is inset into the floor."
